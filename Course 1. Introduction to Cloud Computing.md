# Module 1:- Overview of Cloud Computing

## Why cloud computing?

1. Flexibility & scalibility.
2. Availability.
3. Efficient marketing.

## NIST (**National Institute of Standards and Technology**) definition of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Eg.: Network, Storage, Services, Servers, & Applications.

Cloud computing has 5 essential characterstics, 4 deployment models, & 3 services models.

### 5 Characterstics of Cloud Computing

#### 1. On-demans self-service:-

Access cloud resources whenever required except outage or security breach. Eg: ATM Machine, Vending Machine.

#### 2. Broad network access.

It means data can be access through the network from anywhere & from any device.

#### 3. Resource pooling.

It allows multiple consumers to use same hosting/tools also know as sharing hosting at an affordale price for small businesses.

#### 4. Rapid elasticity.

It allows consumers to increare or decrease the amount of resources as per their demans & budget. Cansumers can also do **Horizontal** or **Vertical** Scaling. ***Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines or nodes to a system, while vertical scaling involves adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.) to an existing machine.** Eg: You can increase your resources in a festive sale, and after that, you can switch back to your normal resources setup/settings.

#### 5. Measured service.

Pay for what you use. It is also termed as ***Utility model of billing***. It means you will be charges at the end of the month.

# Module 2: Cloud Service Models:

## There are 3 types of Cloud Service Models:

### 1. IaaS:

It is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental **compute**, **network**, & **storag****e**, to consumers on-demand pay as you go basis. The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

### 2. PaaS:

it is a form of cloud computing model that provides customers a complete platform to develop, deploy, manage and run applications created by them or acquired from a third party. The PaaS provider hosts everything: servers, networks, storage, operating system, application runtimes, APIs, middleware, databases and other tools at their data center. The provider also takes responsibility for the installation, configuration, and operation of the application infrastructure, leaving the user responsible for only the application code and its maintenance. Customers pay for this service on a usage basis and purchase resources on demand.

### 3. Saas:

It is a cloud offering that provides users with access to a service provider's cloud-based software. SaaS providers maintain the servers, databases, and code that constitute an application. They also manage access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. Applications reside on a remote cloud network, and users use these applications without having to maintain and update the infrastructure. Eg:

1. Email Collaboration: Gmail, Outlook.
2. Customer Relationship Management: Salesforce.
3. Human Resources Management: Workday, SAP SuccessFactors.
4. Finalcial Management.
5. Billing & Collaboration, & many more.

## There are 4 types of cloud deployment models:

### Public cloud:

It is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture enabling tenants or users to share computing resources, residing outside their firewalls. The cloud provider's pool of resources, including infrastructure, platforms, and software, are NOT dedicated for use by a single tenant or organization. Resources are distributed on an as-needed basis offered through a variety of subscription and pay-as-you-go models.

### Private cloud:

It is used by single organization with multiple consumers. It is owned, managed, & operated by organization, third party, or combination. It exist on or off premisis.

It can be implemented **internally** means on-premisis i.e. owned by the organization, or **externally** means owned, managed, & operated by the service provider.

A VPC is a logically isolated section of a data center where you have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including the selection of IP address ranges, etc.

Benefits of private cloud:-

1. It is controlled by IT.
2. It reduces cost.
3. It has better scalability.
4. Controlled access, & security measures customzied as per organizational needs.
5. It has greater agility, it can be scaled in a short amount of time or instant/very fast.

### Community cloud:

Cloud infrastructure [that] is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

### Hybrid cloud:

Hybrid Cloud is a computing environment that connects an organization's on-premise private Cloud and third-party public Cloud, into a single flexible infrastructure for running the organizations applications and workloads. The mix of public and private Cloud resources gives organizations the flexibility to choose the optimal Cloud for each application or workload.

**The 3 key tenants of a hybrid Cloud are interoperability, scalability, and portability.**

**There are two common types of hybrid Clouds, Hybrid Mono Cloud and Hybrid Multi Cloud.** Hybrid Mono Cloud is a Hybrid Cloud with one Cloud provider while a hybrid multi-Cloud is an open standards-based stack that can be deployed on any public Cloud infrastructure. There's also a variant of hybrid multi-Cloud called the composite multi-Cloud, which makes this flexibility even more granular as it distributes single applications across multiple providers, allowing you to move application components across Cloud services and vendors as needed.
